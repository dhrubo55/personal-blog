Hi there! :wave: I'm Somraj Saha (_you can call me Jarmos_).

I work as an independent Software Engineer for a living. Over the years I picked up knowledge in Python & Machine Learning (_mostly due to my academic background in Economics_). And only recently did I start dabbling around with frontend technologies for the Web.

I've listed my tech stack on the [Technology Stack](../services/#technology-stack) section of my Services page. So, in case you would like to hire me, that information might prove useful for you! :heart:

Besides programming, I'm also an amateur Technical Writer. My [blog](../blog/) is one source where you can find most of my up-to-date written content. But, often there's a book or two I keep working on. If you would like to stay updated on their progress, you might want to follow me on Twitter.

But when I'm on the [Terminal][Terminal Emulator], you can find me on Steam probably playing a game or two. If you would like to join me in a game, feel free to drop a message. You can DM me on Discord(**Jarmos#8937**) and/or on my [Steam][Steam Profile](**Jarmos-san**).

### Contact Me

Want to have a professional chat with me? Feel free to drop a DM! :smile:

These are the platforms you can find me on:

- Email: somraj.mle@gmail.com
- Linkedin: [www.linkedin.com/in/jarmos][Linkedin]
- Twitter: [@Jarmosan][Twitter]

**Note**: I'm more active on Twitter, so you'll definitely want to DM me there.
