Hi there! :wave: I am Mohibul Hassan Chowdhury.

I work as an independent Software Engineer for a living. Over the years I picked up knowledge in Python & Machine Learning (_mostly due to my academic background in Economics_). And only recently did I start dabbling around with frontend technologies for the Web.

I've listed my tech stack on the [Technology Stack](../services/#technology-stack) section of my Services page. So, in case you would like to hire me, that information might prove useful for you! :heart:

Besides programming, I'm also an amateur Technical Writer. My [blog](../blog/) is one source where you can find most of my up-to-date written content. But, often there's a book or two I keep working on. If you would like to stay updated on their progress, you might want to follow me on Twitter.
