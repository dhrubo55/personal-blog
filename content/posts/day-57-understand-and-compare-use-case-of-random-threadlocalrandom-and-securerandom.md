To generate random numbers in java there are 4 given ways by the api. In java 17 new generic api and some other api's was introduced.

1. Random Class
2. ThreadLocalRandom Class
3. SecureRandom Class
4. SplitabbleRandom Class

### Random:

The Random Class of the java.util package is used for generating a stream of pseudorandom numbers. It uses a 48-bit seed, and using a `Linear Congruential Formula`.

If we create two instances of the Random class with the same seed value and call the same sequence of methods for each . They both will return identical sequences of numbers. This property is enforced by specific algorithms defined for this class. The algorithms use a protected utility method which upon invocation can give up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits.

Instances of `Random are threadâ€“safe`. Although, if the same instances are used across threads they may suffer from `contention` and result in poor performance. The Instances of Random are `not cryptographically safe`. So should not be used for security-sensitive applications.

```java
public class Day57 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  	  long seed = 5;
      
      Random rng1 = new Random(seed)
      System.out.println(rng.nextInt());
      Random rng2 = new Random(seed)
      System.out.println(rng.nextInt());
      
      
      new Random(seed).ints(5, 10, 100)
                  .forEach(System.out::println);
  }
}
```

### ThreadLocalRandom:

ThreadLocalRandom is a combination of the `ThreadLocal` and `Random` classes. Its isolated to the current thread. So it achieves better performance in a multi-threaded environment. It avoids any concurrent access to instances of Random.

The random number obtained by one thread is not affected by the other thread. Whereas java.util.Random provides random numbers globally.

Also, unlike Random, ThreadLocalRandom doesn't support setting the seed explicitly. Instead, it overrides the `setSeed(long seed)` method. Its inherited from Random and always throw an UnsupportedOperationException if called.


So now we will take a detour and try to understand what is `Thread contention` which is the reason behind `Random classes result in poor performance while being in multi-threaded env`


#### Thread Contention:

when two threads try to access either the same resource or related resources. At least one of the contending threads runs slower than it would if the other thread(s) were not running. This situation is called thread contention.

The most obvious example of contention is on a lock. If thread A has a lock and thread B wants to acquire that same lock, thread B will have to wait until thread A releases the lock.

For example, consider a thread that acquires a lock, modifies an object, then releases the lock and does some other things. If two threads are doing this, even if they never fight for the lock, the threads may run much slower than they would if only one thread was running.

Why? Say each thread is running on its own core on a modern x86 CPU and the cores don't share an L2 cache. With just one thread, the object may remain in the L2 cache most of the time. With both threads running, each time one thread modifies the object, the other thread will find the data is not in its L2 cache because the other CPU invalidated the cache line.
