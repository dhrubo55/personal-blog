To generate random numbers in java there are 4 given ways by the api. In java 17 new generic api and some other api's was introduced. 

1. Random Class
2. ThreadLocalRandom Class
3. SecureRandom Class
4. SplitabbleRandom Class


### Random: 

The Random Class of the java.util package is used for generating a stream of pseudorandom numbers. It uses a 48-bit seed, and using a `Linear Congruential Formula`.

If we create two instances of the Random class with the same seed value and call the same sequence of methods for each . They both will return identical sequences of numbers. This property is enforced by specific algorithms defined for this class. The algorithms use a protected utility method which upon invocation can give up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits. Instances of Random are threadâ€“safe. Although, if the same instances are used across threads they may suffer from `contention` and result in poor performance. The Instances of Random are not cryptographically safe. So should not be used for security-sensitive applications.
