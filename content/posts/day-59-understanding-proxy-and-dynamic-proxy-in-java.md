What is Proxy

Proxy is a design pattern. We create and use proxy objects when we want to add or change some functionality of an existing class. The proxy object is used instead of the original one. Usually, the proxy objects have the same methods as the original one. In Java proxy classes usually extend the original class. The proxy has a handle to the original object and can call the method on that.
