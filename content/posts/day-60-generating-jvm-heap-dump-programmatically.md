### Heap in JVM

At first before we dump the heap we should unnderstand what is the Heap and why should we dump it. In JVM The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM. When the JVM is started, heap memory is created and any objects in the heap can be shared between threads as long as the application is running. The size of the heap can vary, so many users restrict the Java heap size to 2-8 GB in order to minimize garbage collection pauses.

### Why dump Heap Memory

A heap dump is a snapshot of all the objects that are in memory in the JVM at a certain moment. They are very useful to troubleshoot memory-leak problems and optimize memory usage in Java applications.

Heap dumps are usually stored in `binary format hprof files`. We can open and analyze these files using tools like `JVisualVM` and `Eclipse Memory Analyzing Tool`

To generate a heap dump we first need to get a connection to heap and then create the heap dump file. So to that we need the help of java's `JMX` framework.

### What is JMX

Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a standard component of the Java Platform.  It was first added to the J2SE 5.0 release. It is a set of  specifications used for network and application management. It specifies  a method for developers to integrate the applications they are working  on with their network management software by assigning Java objects with  management attributes.

JMX gives developers a standard and simple way to manage resources. Including services, devices, and applications. It is dynamic, making it  possible to manage and monitor resources as soon as they are created,  implemented or installed.

### What is MBean and MBeanServer

With Java Management Extensions technology, a resource is represented by Managed Beans or mBeans.  These are registered on the mBean server. It is a core-managed object server  that acts as an agent and can be used on a majority of devices that  support Java.

In simpler terms, mBeans acts like Java wrappers for 
1. services
2. components
3. devices
4. applications
 
in a distributed network. 

MBean server provides the actual management, as it is where you would  find all the manageable resources. This server then becomes the central  focus of the architectural frame. which allow the server components to plug  in and find manageable objects.

A JMX agent, would consist of the mBean server, and the services needed to handle the mBeans (youâ€™ll also want an APM solution  that includes application framework metrics like mBeans and performance  counters). This means that the resources are independent and apart from  the management infrastructure. while these resources are manageable no  matter how the management applications are deployed.
