What is JMX

The Java Management Extensions (JMX) API is a standard for managing and monitoring applications and services.

It defines -

1\. management architecture

2\. design patterns

3\. APIs

4\. services

for building web-based, distributed, dynamic, and modular solutions to manage Java-enabled resources. The JMX APIs make it possible to add manageability to Java-enabled applications, from web phones to set-top boxes to network devices and servers.

The JVM gives you a set of MBeans through which you can access runtime data like **memory consumption**, **GC stats** and some more data. You can also invoke many operations. Your app server will also give you many MBeans which you can use to control the server and installed applications.
