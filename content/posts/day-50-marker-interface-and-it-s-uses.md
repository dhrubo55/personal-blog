At first lets understand what is an Interface in Java

### Interface:
An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods and from java 8 default implementations.

The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be abstract methods in the Java interface, and method body for default methods. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
