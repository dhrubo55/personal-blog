Inside out strategy

1. explain what a vm is then what is ALV and how jvm is a application level ALV
2. explain what is a runtime enviornment and how it interacts with underlying os and jvm
3. how does jre compiles bytecode and what is byte code
4. execution model of java and how a program gets executed
5. model diagrams and explain

When we talk about JVM aka java virtual machine. So lets first understand what is virtual machine.  
  
### Virtual Machine:
