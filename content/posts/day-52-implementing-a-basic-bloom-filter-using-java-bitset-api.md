1,

First of all lets understand what is a Bloom Filter and how does it work and what are its usages.

Bloom Filter :

Bloom filter is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set.

The price paid for this efficiency is that a Bloom filter is a **probabilistic data structure**: it tells us that the element either _definitely is not_ in the set or _may be_ in the set

For example, checking availability of username. In this case its a set membership problem, where the set is the list of all registered username. The price we pay for efficiency is that it is probabilistic in nature. That means, there might be some False Positive results. **False positive means**, it might tell that given username is already taken but actually itâ€™s not.

here in this scenario we are searching for the user name `Mary` in the bloom filter. So from the picture we can see a bloom filter is a combination of a hash function and a bit array or list. Where after hashing the user name will give us a number in which we will set the bit to true.   
  
So if we use different hash functions and then  update the bit array with 1 where the index of the array would be number provided by the hash function. Then if we search the name again with those hash functions and check the index's again and if we find 1 there then we can plausibly say that, that name exist in the bloom filter.
